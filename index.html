      <h1>Medium embraces Mastodon</h1>
      <h2>
        The fediverse is a breath of fresh air for writers and social media
      </h2>
      <div class="paragraph-container">
        <p>
          Today, Medium is launching a Mastodon instance at me.dm to help our
          authors, publications and readers find a home in the fediverse.
          Mastodon is an emerging force for good in social media and we are
          excited to join this community.
        </p>
        <p>
          We think the mission of Medium — to deepen people’s understanding of
          the world by helping to share the best ideas and best information —
          transcends mediums. To date, we’ve focused on article-length writing.
          It’s how our company got its name: as a home for medium-length writing
          on the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          By contrast, Mastodon is primarily for short-form writing of 500
          characters or less. Not to be overly punny: Today we are extending
          what we do into the short-form medium (lowercase m) with an instance
          on Mastodon, me.dm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from being short-form, Mastodon also brings an important
          innovation around the concept of federation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Federation is a form of decentralization. This means that instead of
          everyone being in the same community, there are many communities that
          can talk to each other. The lingo is to refer to these communities as
          instances. When you join Mastodon, you join one community as your home
          base. The collection of instances that talk to each other is referred
          to as the fediverse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is for the me.dm instance to be a valuable home base for many
          people.
        </p>
        <p>To that end:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you are already on Mastodon, follow us here me.dm/@medium. Our
            account aims to boost smart information and ideas, and also to help
            find and recommend interesting accounts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tomorrow we will start inviting select authors and publications. If
            you want to be in the early group, sign up here.
          </li>
          <li>
            Shortly we will invite all of our Medium writers and readers as an
            additional service within our membership. We are working on a
            “sign-up with Medium” option that will make it easy to get started
            on Mastodon, and to find people and topics that match your
            interests. If you want to be in our early list of invites, sign up
            here.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With so many Mastodon instances to choose from, we plan for me.dm to
          have a few important benefits out of the gate: reliable infrastructure
          and moderation, a short domain name to make sharing your username
          easier, better onboarding for new users, and an interesting local
          feed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like all new platforms, there is a learning curve. We are especially
          cognizant that we are joining an existing Mastodon ecosystem which
          already has 9 million people. This ecosystem has existing community
          norms that are especially focused on avoiding the toxicity that have
          plagued other social media platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s one reason we aren’t yet allowing access for all Medium
          members. We need to clarify the Venn diagram that is the best of
          Medium and the best of Mastodon. We have very overlapping views of
          healthy community norms and I think we will mix very well. This
          navigation of community norms is why we consider federation to be the
          most exciting innovation in social media.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to find out more, we’ve created a list of some of the best
          writing about Mastodon from our authors.
        </p>
        <p>
          And of course, if you want to talk to me, I’m always listening. Leave
          a response here, or reach out to me on Mastodon at @coachtony@me.dm.
